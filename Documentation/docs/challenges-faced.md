# CHALLENGES Faced

* Why we can't break AES:
    1) Strong Key Size:
        AES has 128–256 bits of key which is too large for brute force.

    2) Complex Structure:
        Many rounds of substitution and mixing hide patterns.

    3) No Practical Attack:
        Breaking AES is only theoreotical Concept.

* Difficulty in Finding Datasets for various ciphers for Side channel Attacks.
