# Why CNN is used for SCA

1) **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are effective for Side-Channel Attack because they capture local leakage patterns present in power traces.

2) The Convolutional Filters slide across the trace and automatically learns important local features.




# Why not RNN

1) **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** focus on sequential dependencies

2) Unlike RNNs, CNNs emphasize on local patterns.
