## Mini-Project 1
* Implemented a simple Caeser-Cipher model using simple FFNN i.e Feedforward Neural Networks.
* Helped in building a base to understand what ciphers are and how do they work

## Mini-Project 2:
* Implemented SCA model for AES using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

## Mini-Project 3:
* Encoder-only transformer model to classify b/w monosubstituion,polysubstituion.
